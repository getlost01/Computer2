## Logisim Circuit Designs for Computer Architecture with Multiprogramming and ROM

This repository contains Logisim circuit designs for a basic computer architecture with multiprogramming and ROM. The circuits are designed to simulate the basic functionality of a computer, including the control unit, ALU, registers, and memory. Additionally, multiprogramming is implemented to allow the computer to execute multiple programs simultaneously.

## Getting Started

To use the circuit designs, you will need to download and install Logisim. Once Logisim is installed, you can open any of the `.circ` files in the repository to view and simulate the circuits.
